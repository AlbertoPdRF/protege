# Getting started
Here at Proteg√©, we use create-react-app on the front-end, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Google Firebase for the back-end.
Getting a local environment set up is fairly simple.

1. Pull down the development branch
2. Run ```npm i``` to install peer deps
3. Contact [Drew](mailto:drewclementsdesign@gmail.com) to get dev env variables

And you're good to go!
